	<button class="button">SORT</button>

	<p> 
		Unfortunately, I wasn't able to build the visualization I wanted, however I will explain in detail what I had hoped
		to achieve. I chose a data set about student enrollment at UW (Seattle campus) in 2015, which is broken down by 
		ethnicities. My intended message for this data visualization was to highlight the state of diversity on campus by 
		showing which minority groups are especially miniscule and which ones are larger by contrast. Also, a layer within the data that is interesting for drawing
		comparisons is the diversity of Asian ethnicities; there are various Southeast Asian ethnic groups in the data set. 
		<br>
		<br>
		I chose a pie chart layout for two main reasons: the first being that pie charts are useful for representing how individual
		parts add up to a whole (a grand total, which is the student body in this case); and the second reason is that the elementary
		perceptual task of judging data based on angle and area are accurate ways to perceive this type of information.
		<br> 
		<br>
		I should also add that I intended to have a "sort" button that breaks up the first pie chart to reveal the second layer of 
		data that I found interesting. In addition to showing the total populations for ethnic groups, the data set breaks down these totals
		into male/female representations. Visually, I wanted the first pie chart's slices to drift outwards and each slice would then
		break into two (one for male numbers, and the other for female).
